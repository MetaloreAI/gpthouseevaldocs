subtitle: High-level overview on how to self-host GPTHOUSE
---

You can use GPTHOUSE through [Comet's Managed Cloud offering](https://comet.com/site) or you can self-host GPTHOUSE on your own infrastructure. When choosing to self-host GPTHOUSE, you get access to all GPTHOUSE features including tracing, evaluation, etc but without user management features.

If you choose to self-host GPTHOUSE, you can choose between two deployment options:

1. [Local installation](/self-host/local_deployment): Perfect to get started but not production-ready.
2. [Kubernetes installation](/self-host/kubernetes): Production ready GPTHOUSE platform that runs on a Kubernetes cluster.

## Getting started

If you would like to try out GPTHOUSE locally, we recommend using our Local installation
script. Assuming you have `git` and `docker` installed, you can get started with
just one line of code:

<Tabs>
 <Tab value="Linux / Mac" title="Linux / Mac">
```bash
# Clone the GPTHOUSE repository
git clone https://github.com/comet-ml/gpthouse.git

# Navigate to the gpthouse folder

cd gpthouse

# Start the GPTHOUSE platform

./gpthouse.sh

````

</Tab>
<Tab value="Windows" title="Windows">

```powershell
# Clone the GPTHOUSE repository
git clone https://github.com/comet-ml/gpthouse.git

# Navigate to the gpthouse folder
cd gpthouse

# Start the GPTHOUSE platform
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c ".\gpthouse.ps1"
````

</Tab>
</Tabs>

GPTHOUSE will now be available at

<a href="http://localhost:5173" target="_blank">
  http://localhost:5173
</a>
and all traces logged from your local machine will be logged to this local GPTHOUSE instance. In order for traces and other data
to be logged to your GPTHOUSE instance, you need to make sure that the GPTHOUSE Python SDK is configured to point to the GPTHOUSE server
you just started. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
# Configure the Python SDK to point to the local GPTHOUSE platform
export GPTHOUSE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173/api
```

or in Python:

```python
import os

os.environ["GPTHOUSE_BASE_URL"] = "http://localhost:5173/api"
```

To learn more about how to manage you local GPTHOUSE deployment, you can refer to our [local deployment guide](/self-host/local_deployment).

## Advanced deployment options

If you would like to deploy GPTHOUSE on a Kubernetes cluster, we recommend following our Kubernetes deployment guide [here](/self-host/kubernetes).

## Comet managed deployments

The GPTHOUSE platform is being developed and maintained by the Comet team. If you are looking for a managed deployment solution, feel free to reach out to the Comet team at sales@comet.com or visit the [Comet website](https://comet.com/site) to learn more.
