subtitle: Describes the usage statistics that are collected by GPTHOUSE
---

GPTHOUSE includes a system that optionally sends anonymous reports non-sensitive, non-personally identifiable information about the usage of the GPTHOUSE platform. This information is used to help us understand how the GPTHOUSE platform is being used and to identify areas for improvement.

The anonymous usage statistics reporting is enabled by default. You can opt-out by setting the `OPIK_USAGE_REPORT_ENABLED` environment variable to `false`.

## What data is collected?

When usage statistics reporting is enabled, report are collected by a server that is run and maintained by the GPTHOUSE team.

The usage statistics include the following information:

- Information about the GPTHOUSE server version:
  - A randomly generated ID that is unique to the GPTHOUSE server instance such as `bdc47d37-2256-4604-a31e-18a34567cad1`
  - The GPTHOUSE server version such as `0.1.7`
- Information about GPTHOUSE users: This is not relevant for self-hosted deployments as no user management is available.
  - Total number of users
  - Daily number of users
- Information about GPTHOUSE's usage reported daily:
  - The number of traces created
  - The number of experiments created
  - The number of datasets created

No personally identifiable information is collected and no user data is sent to the GPTHOUSE team. The event payload that is sent to the GPTHOUSE team follows the format:

```json
{
  "anonymous_id": "bdc47d37-2256-4604-a31e-18a34567cad1",
