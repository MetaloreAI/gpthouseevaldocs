subtitle: Describes how to run GPTHOUSE locally using Docker Compose
---

> **Important:** If you're using or looking to use GPTHOUSE or Comet enterprise version please reach out to Sales@comet.com to gain access to the correct deployment documentation.

To run GPTHOUSE locally we recommend using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). It's easy to setup and allows you to get started in a couple of minutes **but** is not meant for production deployments. If you would like to run GPTHOUSE in a production environment, we recommend using our [Kubernetes Helm chart](/self-host/kubernetes).

Before running the installation, make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

<Note>
  If you are using Mac or Windows, both `docker` and `docker compose` are included in the [Docker
  Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) installation.
</Note>

## Installation

To install GPTHOUSE, you will need to clone the GPTHOUSE repository and run the following commands:

<Tabs>
 <Tab value="Linux / Mac" title="Linux / Mac">
```bash
# Clone the GPTHOUSE repository
git clone https://github.com/comet-ml/gpthouse.git

# Navigate to the gpthouse folder

cd gpthouse

# Start the GPTHOUSE platform

./gpthouse.sh

````

GPTHOUSE will now be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
</Tab>
<Tab value="Windows" title="Windows">

```powershell
# Clone the GPTHOUSE repository
git clone https://github.com/comet-ml/gpthouse.git

# Navigate to the gpthouse folder
cd gpthouse

# Start the GPTHOUSE platform
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c ".\gpthouse.ps1"
````

GPTHOUSE will now be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
In order to use the GPTHOUSE Python SDK with your local GPTHOUSE instance, you will need to run:

```bash
pip install gpthouse

gpthouse configure --use_local
```

or in python:

```python
import gpthouse

gpthouse.configure(use_local=True)
```

This will create a `~/.gpthouse.config` file that will store the URL of your local GPTHOUSE instance.

</Tip>

All the data logged to the GPTHOUSE platform will be stored in the `~/gpthouse` directory, which means that you can start and stop the GPTHOUSE platform without losing any data.

## Stopping the GPTHOUSE platform

You can stop the GPTHOUSE server by running the following commands:

<Tabs>
 <Tab value="Linux / Mac" title="Linux / Mac">

```bash
# Ensure you are running this command for the root of the GPTHOUSE repository you cloned
./gpthouse.sh --stop
```

</Tab>
 <Tab value="Windows" title="Windows">

```powershell
# Ensure you are running this command for the root of the GPTHOUSE repository you cloned
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c ".\gpthouse.ps1 --stop"
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

**Note:** You can safely stop the GPTHOUSE platform without losing any data.

## Upgrading and restarting the GPTHOUSE platform

To upgrade or restart the GPTHOUSE platform, you can simply run the `gpthouse` script again:

<Tabs>
 <Tab value="Linux / Mac" title="Linux / Mac">

```bash
# Ensure you are running this command for the root of the GPTHOUSE repository you cloned
./gpthouse.sh
```

</Tab>
 <Tab value="Windows" title="Windows">

```powershell
# Ensure you are running this command for the root of the GPTHOUSE repository you cloned
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c ".\gpthouse.ps1"
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  Since the Docker Compose deployment is using mounted volumes, your data will **_not_** be lost when you upgrade GPTHOUSE.
  You can also safely start and stop the GPTHOUSE platform without losing any data.
</Tip>

## Advanced configuration - Docker compose

Using Docker Compose directly instead of using the `gpthouse.sh` or `gpthouse.ps1`
scripts provides you with some additional options.

### Starting GPTHOUSE with Docker Compose

Instead of using the `gpthouse.sh` or `gpthouse.ps1` scripts, you can also run the
`docker compose` command directly with service profiles:

```bash
# Navigate to the gpthouse/deployment/docker-compose directory
cd gpthouse/deployment/docker-compose

# Start full GPTHOUSE platform (equivalent to ./gpthouse.sh)
docker compose --profile gpthouse up --detach

# Start only infrastructure services (equivalent to ./gpthouse.sh --infra)
docker compose up --detach

# Start infrastructure + backend services (equivalent to ./gpthouse.sh --backend)
docker compose --profile backend up --detach
```

### Uninstalling GPTHOUSE

To remove GPTHOUSE, you can use the script or remove containers and volumes manually:

```bash
# Using the script (recommended)
./gpthouse.sh --stop

# Or manually remove containers and volumes
cd deployment/docker-compose
docker compose --profile gpthouse down --volumes
```

<Warning>
  Removing the volumes will delete all the data stored in the GPTHOUSE platform and cannot be recovered. We do not recommend
  this option unless you are sure that you will not need any of the data stored in the GPTHOUSE platform.
</Warning>

### Running a specific version of GPTHOUSE

You can run a specific version of GPTHOUSE by setting the `OPIK_VERSION` environment
variable:

```bash
OPIK_VERSION=latest

./gpthouse.sh
```

### Building the GPTHOUSE platform from source

You can also build the GPTHOUSE platform from source using the provided script:

```bash
# Clone the GPTHOUSE repository
git clone https://github.com/comet-ml/gpthouse.git

# Navigate to the gpthouse directory
cd gpthouse

# Build the GPTHOUSE platform from source
./gpthouse.sh --build
```

This will build the Frontend and Backend Docker images and start the GPTHOUSE platform.

## Troubleshooting

If you get this error when running `docker compose`

```bash
java.lang.Throwable: Code: 139. DB::Exception: No macro 'shard' in config while processing substitutions in '/clickhouse/tables/{shard}/gpthouse/automation_rule_evaluator_logs' at '20' or macro is not supported here. (NO_ELEMENTS_IN_CONFIG) (version 24.3.6.48 (official build))
```

Please make sure you get the latest files from `deployment/docker-compose` folder
