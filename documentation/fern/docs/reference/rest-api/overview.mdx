<Info>
  The GPTHOUSE REST API is stable but currently in beta and subject to change. If you have any questions or feedback about
  the APIs, please reach out on GitHub: https://github.com/comet-ml/gpthouse.
</Info>

The Rest API can be used with both the Open-Source platform and GPTHOUSE Cloud. The main differences are related to the URL
to use and request headers used for authentication.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Open-Source">
    If you are using the Open-Source platform you can simply use the `http://localhost:5173/api/v1/<endpoint_path>`:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET 'http://localhost:5173/api/v1/private/projects'
    ```

    </Tab>
    <Tab title="GPTHOUSE Cloud">
    If you are using GPTHOUSE Cloud or a on-premise installation of the Comet platform, you will need to specify the GPTHOUSE
    API Key and GPTHOUSE Workspace in the header:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET 'https://www.comet.com/gpthouse/api/v1/private/projects' \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Comet-Workspace: <your-workspace-name>' \
    -H 'authorization: <your-api-key>'
    ```

    <Warning>
    Note that the authorization header value does not include the `Bearer ` prefix.
