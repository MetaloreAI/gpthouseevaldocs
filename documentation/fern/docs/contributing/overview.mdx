## Project Setup and Architecture

The GPTHOUSE project is made up of five main sub-projects:

- `apps/gpthouse-documentation`: The GPTHOUSE documentation website (this site!)
- `sdks/python`: The GPTHOUSE Python SDK
- `sdks/typescript`: The GPTHOUSE TypeScript SDK
- `sdks/gpthouse_optimizer`: The GPTHOUSE Agent Optimizer SDK
- `apps/gpthouse-frontend`: The GPTHOUSE frontend application
- `apps/gpthouse-backend`: The GPTHOUSE backend server

GPTHOUSE relies on: Clickhouse (traces, spans, feedback), MySQL (metadata), and Redis (caching).

The local development environment uses convenient scripts (`./gpthouse.sh` for Linux/Mac, `.\gpthouse.ps1` for Windows) that manage Docker Compose automatically. Please see instructions in the [deployment/docker-compose/README.md](https://github.com/comet-ml/gpthouse/blob/main/deployment/docker-compose/README.md) on GitHub for advanced usage.
